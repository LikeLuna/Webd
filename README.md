# Bubble Game
I've recently created an engaging game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project highlights my proficiency in front-end development, integrating responsive click responses, customizable timer settings, and immersive sound effects. The game includes seamless restart functionality, showcasing my technical abilities and dedication to user-centric design.
